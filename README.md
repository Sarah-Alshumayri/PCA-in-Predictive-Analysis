# Exploring the Effectiveness of PCA in Predictive Analysis of Sleep Disorders

This project investigates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to improve the predictive analysis of sleep disorders using high-dimensional data. It compares the effectiveness of various machine learning models before and after applying PCA, highlighting its impact on performance and accuracy.

## Project Overview

The study focuses on predicting sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea using the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle** dataset. By reducing the dataset's dimensionality with PCA, the study aims to improve the efficiency of machine learning models and provide more interpretable results.

### Key Components:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using PCA to simplify datasets while retaining critical information.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Application of RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and training time before and after PCA implementation.

### Tools Used:
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, PCA implementation, and machine learning model training.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing PCA and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting PCA components.
